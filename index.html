        <BR>

        <P>I spent this year teaching myself how to code. It has been a crazy ride. If you want to learn web development or have already started, here are some things that helped me the most.</P>
<BR>
         <h2> Online Courses</h2> <BR>

         <P> My first resource was Codecademy. As a beginner, their courses were amazing. The explanations made a lot of sense. The exercises gave me a feel for coding. Later, freeCodeCamp gave me extra practice and covered additional concepts. I alternated between the two and they seemed to fill in each otherâ€™s gaps.</P> <br>
          <P>Eventually, I settled with freeCodeCamp. I liked the curriculum and felt I would be a competent full-stack developer by the end of it. It ended up being a good choice but I often relied on other resources too. One major and unexpected source of learning has been people: smart, generous, awesome people! </P>
          <BR>
         <H3>Other Developers </H3> <BR>

          <P>A friend suggested I go to the local freeCodeCamp study group. It was my first time talking to other developers. I was blown away by how welcoming and supportive they were!</P> <br>
          <P>They were at various levels of experience. Some had jobs and were working on side projects. Others were learning through programs like Treehouse or the Odin Project. When they found out I had just started my journey, they gave me tons of helpful tips.</P> <br>
         <P> One guy showed me his GitHub profile and explained how important it was to be active there. He said hiring managers look at three things: your GitHub, your portfolio, and your LinkedIn.</P>
<BR><BR>
          <H4>My GitHub activity</H4>
<BR>
          <P>I had made a portfolio page and timidly showed it to the group. It was nothing but a title, a picture, and a caption. All in Times New Roman! I expected to hear criticism or some polite grunts but instead received congratulations! They loved the fact that I had already hosted the site myself and even used my own domain name. </P> <br>
          <P>I remember asking all sorts of questions. I learned more in those two hours than in a whole day of studying at home. From that moment, I realized that talking to other developers would be a huge part of my learning experience. It was energizing, encouraging, and helped me focus on the important stuff.</P>
